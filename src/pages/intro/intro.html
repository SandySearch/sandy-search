    <h1>Welcome to SandySearch!</h1>
    <h4>Croud-sourced Emergency Services for During and After a Disaster</h4>
    <p>I was in Super Storm Sandy in 2012, and was without power for 9 days.</p>
    <p>After the storm, we had a very hard time discovering what services (gasoline, food, water, ice, power, ATMs) were available (both when and where).</p>
    <p>And if you have only a half a tank of gas, you don't want to drive around looking for more, without knowing where to go.</p>

    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>The idea for this service is to use the power of crowdsourcing (think "Waze for Services, after a disaster").</p>
    <p>It currently allows <strong>anyone</strong> (without a login) to search and report on services available in their area.</p>

    <p>Verified users (pre-registered, think Red Cross, National Guard, and business owners/managers) can leave <strong>"verified"</strong> service status updates, at no cost.</p>

    <p>All usage is anonymous, if not logged in.</p>
