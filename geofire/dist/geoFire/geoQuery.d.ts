     * fired for the updated query.
     *
     * 'key_entered' fires when a key enters this query. This can happen when a key moves from a location outside of
     * this query to one inside of it or when a key is written to GeoFire for the first time and it falls within
     * this query.
     *
     * 'key_exited' fires when a key moves from a location inside of this query to one outside of it. If the key was
     * entirely removed from GeoFire, both the location and distance passed to the callback will be null.
